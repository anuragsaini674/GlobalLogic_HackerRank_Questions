/*Given a linked list of N nodes such that it may contain a loop.

A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to the node at position X(1-based index). If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.

Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present, i.e. unlink the last node which is forming the loop.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
X = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The link list looks like
1 -> 3 -> 4
     ^    |
     |____|    
A loop is present. If you remove it 
successfully, the answer will be 1. 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
X = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: The Linked list does not 
contains any loop. 

Example 3:

Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,2,3,4}
X = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The link list looks like 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
^              |
|______________|
A loop is present. 
If you remove it successfully, 
the answer will be 1. */
